# ScalesDatabase
Cross-cultural database of musical scales

Three sets of scales are available in Data:

theory_scales.csv, scales where intervals and scale degrees are exactly specified by frequency ratios. These are mainly available in symbolic notation, and need to be further processed before scale degrees are available in cents.

measured_scales.csv, a mixture of instrument tunings and scales inferred from recordings.

octave_scales.csv, combination of the two sets of raw data, after being processed so that each scale spans an octave.
