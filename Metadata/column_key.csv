Column,Description
TheoryID,In 'theory.tsv' a unique ID is given for each named scale. This ID should persist when the 'same' scale is used with different tuning systems.
MeasuredID,In 'measured.tsv' a unique ID is given for each measurement.
Name,"Some sort of name; not necessarily unique, and not used for indexing. Often chosen to help identify the data in the source."
Ascending Intervals,"Adjacent intervals in order of increasing frequency. Stored as either integers separated by semicolons, or correspond to a code that matches with a tuning system."
Descending Intervals,"Adjacent intervals in order of increasing frequency. Stored as either integers separated by semicolons, or correspond to a code that matches with a tuning system. These are only included when there is a difference between ascending and descending versions of the same scale."
Tonic,Information on tonality: a single number indicates a single tonic; a list of numbers clearly indicates the position of each note in the hierarchy. The total count of 'tonic notes' should be one greater than the number of 'Intervals'.
Variants,"A list of variants that are used in a given tuning system. These are stored as a list of variants separated by commas, where notes in the variant are separated by semicolons."
Culture,"This can be a musical tradition, a country, a language group, or the name of a group of people."
SocID,"A unique ID is given for each society. These are defined at different levels of granularity (e.g., continent-level musical tradition, language group, country, etc.)."
Region,Which geographical region was the scale / instrument from / where was a recording made?
Tuning,"This is used to match Theory scales with their tuning systems. If more than one tuning system is used: they can be listed in the same row, separated by a semi-colon; or given a separate row for each tuning system."
Reference,Reference where the information is obtained
Theory,Is it a theoretical scale? Or is it a scale / instrument tuning that has been measured empirically?
RefID,Reference ID: links with 'source_list' sheet
Primary_source?,Is this a primary source?
Country,"This is mainly used for creating the distribution on a world map; there are a few cases (they should be noted) where the exact country is not known, but guessed."
Measured_type,"Indicates if data was taken from an instrument tuning, or from a song recording."
Instrument,Instrument name given in source (some spellings have been changed for consistency in transliteration).
Inst_type,Hornbostel-Sachs classification
Melodic / Harmonic,Was the measurement made using melodic intervals or harmonic intervals?
Octave_modified,"Is there evidence to say that the octave is used, but a final interval is not reported? If so, add the final interval when creating the list of scales."
Reduced_scale,"Occasionally, a scale extends beyond an octave range yet the source only reports a truncated verion, which is collapsed onto a single octave."
Notes,"Other relevant, or interesting details."
