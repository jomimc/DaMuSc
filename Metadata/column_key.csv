,Column,Description
0,TheoryID,In 'theory.tsv' a unique ID is given for each scale. This ID should persist when the 'same' scale is used with different tuning systems. In 'measured.tsv' the TheoryID is given if there is a known match between the measured scale and a theory scale.
1,MeasuredID,In 'measured.tsv' a unique ID is given for each measurement.
2,Name,Some sort of name; not necessarily unique; often used to help identify where in the source it was found.
3,Ascending Intervals,"Adjacent intervals in order of increasing frequency. Stored as either integers separated by semicolons, or correspond to a code that matches with a tuning system."
4,Descending Intervals,"Adjacent intervals in order of increasing frequency. Stored as either integers separated by semicolons, or correspond to a code that matches with a tuning system. These are only included when there is a difference between ascending and descending versions of the same scale."
5,Tonic,Information on tonality: a single number indicates a single tonic; a list of numbers clearly indicates the position of each note in the hierarchy. The total count of +IBgAnA-tonic notes' should be one greater than the number of 'Intervals'.
6,Modes,"A list of modes that are used in a given tuning system. These are stored as a list of modes separated by commas, where notes in the mode are separated by semicolons."
7,Culture,"This can be a musical tradition, a country, a language group, or the name of a group of people."
8,Region,Which geographical region was the scale / instrument from / where was a recording made?
9,Tuning,This is used to match Theory scales with their tuning systems
10,Reference,Reference where the information is obtained
11,Theory,Is it a theoretical scale? Or is it a scale / instrument tuning that has been measured empirically?
12,RefID,Reference ID: links with 'source_list' sheet
13,Primary_source?,Is this a primary source?
14,Country,"This is only used for creating the distribution on a world map; there are a few cases (they should be noted) where the exact country is not known, but guessed."
15,Measured_type,"Indicates if data was taken from an instrument tuning, or from a song recording."
16,Instrument,Instrument name given in source (some spellings have been changed for consistency in transliteration).
17,Inst_type,Hornbostel-Sachs classification
18,Octave_modified,"Is there evidence to say that the octave is used, but a final interval is not reported? If so, add the final interval when creating the list of scales."
19,Reduced_scale,"Is the scale truncated at, or collapsed onto the octave?"
