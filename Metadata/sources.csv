Fennica Gehrman Ltd., 2018",,"Many scales were omitted that were identical to those in Ref 1. There is a chapter devoted to ancient Greek scales. There is a lot of information here, but I decided that the previous inclusion of diatonic modes is sufficient. It might be worthwhile going back over this some day to include all of the hyper- and hypo- versions of the modes, where alternative types of pythagorean tunings are used. After reading the sources in the bibliography (see David Monroe, The Modes of Ancient Greek Music), it seems that I am right to be skeptical - the use of this extended set of modes seems to be hypothetical. I also do not include the section on modes where the author seems to simply be enumerating circular permutants of scales. Reports of scales in Western staff notation are ignored if there is no tuning system specified. Sometimes there were extensions of Turkish scales above and below the octave - these were only included as new scales if there were differences between the notes in the upper and lower octaves. Many of the Turkish scales were duplicates, and occasionally the information was confusing. It would be good to eventually get a better source for these.",,"Too many cultures, too little information",,,,,4,0,57,0.070175438596491,0,

In many instances the 'tempered' version of recorded scales are given. I ignore these as they appear to be imposed by the author. Any other attempts at guesswork were likewise ignored. For some tunings, it was difficult to read the origin of the instrument. Typically this is true for museum specimens. These cases were ignored. I could not read some pages (Western Africa) in the scan that I have access to. This source contained a lot of instrument tunings that only consisted of exact just-tuned intervals (90 cents, 204 cents, etc), and the source is not clear on how these numbers were obtained; in these cases I declined to record them as they appear to be guessed.
