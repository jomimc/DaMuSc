+ACM-,+ACI-Reasons for not using sources / scales, and other notes+ACI-
1,+ACI-Exclude if:  it is impossible to extract details about the exact tuning, as measured in Hz or cents.+ACI-
2,+ACI-Exclude if:  instrument tunings are present, but in a non+AC0-coherent order (mix of ascending and descending).+ACI-
3,Exclude if:  only contains +IBg-theory+IBk- scales that are confirmed to already exist in the database.
4,Exclude if:  ambiguity in scale when a frequency range is reported for a note instead of a single value.
5,+ACI-Exclude if: data is reported in figures, but not in tables.+ACI-
6,+ACI-Exclude if:  chromatic scales (e.g. 12+AC0-TET, 24+AC0-TET, etc.) are considered whole tuning systems, and not indicative of scales as they are played. There is also the possibility that this is true for other tunings that we find (e.g. 7+AC0-TET), but do not assume differences between tuning systems and scales unless there is evidence.+ACI-
7,Tonic is inferred as the first note in a scale in a demonstration by a performer.
8,Same set of intervals starting on a different fundamental frequency are considered equivalent. i.e. exclude transposed versions of the same scale.
