Reasons for not using sources / scales and other notes.
Exclude if: it is impossible to extract details about the exact tuning as measured in Hz or cents.
Exclude if: instrument tunings are present but in a non-coherent order (mix of ascending and descending).
Exclude if: only contains `theory' scales that are confirmed to already exist in the database.
Exclude if: ambiguity in scale when a frequency range is reported for a note instead of a single value.
Exclude if: data is reported in figures but cannot be reliably extracted.
Exclude if: chromatic scales (e.g. 12-TET; 24-TET; etc.) are considered whole tuning systems and not indicative of scales as they are played. There is also the possibility that this is true for other tunings that we find (e.g. 7-TET); such tuning systems (7 or fewer notes) are plausibly used as scales so we include them unless there is evidence to support the contrary.
Tonic is inferred as the first note in a scale in a demonstration by a performer.
Same set of intervals starting on a different fundamental frequency are considered equivalent. i.e. exclude transposed versions of the same scale.
